            <p class="lead fw-semibold mb-4">Twitter, launched in 2006 by Jack Dorsey, Biz Stone, and Evan Williams, has become one of the most influential and widely used social media platforms globally. It is headquartered in San Francisco, California, and has played a significant role in reshaping how people communicate, share information, and engage with current events.
                <br>
                Twitter's defining feature is the "tweet," a short message or post limited to 280 characters (formerly 140 characters) that users can share with their followers. This concise format encourages quick, real-time communication and has given rise to a unique and often fast-paced form of online conversation.
                <br>
                The platform has been instrumental in disseminating news, serving as a real-time information hub during major events, disasters, and breaking news. It has also facilitated global conversations on a wide range of topics, from politics and sports to entertainment and culture.
                <br>
                Twitter's impact on politics and activism is undeniable. Politicians, world leaders, and activists use the platform to engage with their constituents and followers, making it a vital tool for political communication and advocacy. The use of hashtags (#) to organize and track discussions has become a hallmark of Twitter's influence.
                <br>
                Twitter's role in entertainment and celebrity culture is also significant. Celebrities, musicians, and influencers use the platform to connect with fans, share updates, and promote their work. Trends on Twitter can drive the popularity of songs, movies, and other cultural phenomena.
                <br>
                Twitter's Moments feature, introduced in 2015, allows users to curate and present stories and events in a narrative format. It has become a valuable tool for summarizing and exploring trending topics.
                <br>
                Live-streaming on Twitter, through services like Periscope (which Twitter acquired in 2015), has brought real-time video content to the platform. This has enabled users to broadcast and engage with live events, interviews, and behind-the-scenes glimpses.
                <br>
                However, Twitter has faced challenges, including issues related to harassment, hate speech, and the spread of misinformation on the platform. The company has made efforts to combat these problems through improved content moderation and policies.
                <br>
                The character limit for tweets, once a defining feature, was expanded to 280 characters in 2017, allowing users to express themselves more freely. Twitter has also introduced features like Twitter Spaces, which enables audio conversations, and Fleets, which are temporary disappearing posts, in an effort to diversify its offerings.
                <br>
                In recent years, Twitter has focused on enhancing user experiences and fostering healthy online conversations while maintaining its status as a global forum for news, discussion, and connection. With its continued evolution, Twitter remains a dynamic force in the world of social media and online communication.<a
